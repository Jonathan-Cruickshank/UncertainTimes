Freelance Writer- The Uncertain Times
May 2018 – Present
Newport, South Wales
https://jonathan-cruickshank.github.io/UncertainTimes/
My ever-evolving blog where I post mental health and political journalism, as well as personal projects. I provided all the articles posted and coded the website.

I wrote several articles about local charity events as well as historical pieces about how charities form and operate. I've successfully established the habit of writing every day and built a secure toolkit to work at home or away. The regular writing practice keeps my touch-typing skills sharp, I’m currently averaging 66 words a minute with around 98% accuracy.

I have experience backing up my data using the 3-2-1 method. I do this by keeping one copy on Google Drive and using VeraCrypt to encrypt two flash drives which I keep in secondary locations.

Having a place I was in control of to publish my work has allowed me to stand on my own and enjoy the freedom to experiment with different mediums including creative non-fiction and dev diaries of my coding projects. I also experienced the responsibility of considering what I want to publish and how I want to present myself.

My current writing project is rewriting several essays I wrote on social science and criminology as part of my ongoing Open University degree, this time with the benefit of my tutor’s comments.

Freelance Web Design- The Uncertain Times
September 2021– Present
Newport, South Wales
https://github.com/Jonathan-Cruickshank/UncertainTimes/
Creating this website has given me experience working in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Since I’m self-taught, I was able to gain experience drawing from multiple sources of information on the topic of coding.

I’ve learned web design concepts such as considering the flow of information, which parts people will read first and why, and how to group my articles together to maintain interest so people will read more and explore my other projects.

Currently I’m planning to add data analysis tools to track site traffic and demographics. I’m also researching web design to give the site some colour. The project is currently hosted through GitHub Pages, but I’m researching hosting it through a custom-made server that I would control.
	  
AIM Awards Food Drink and Cooking
Sep 2015 – Feb 2016
Lancaster and Morecambe College
This course focused on food preparation in one of the College’s lab kitchens. If the College was hosting an event, including the school music festival I performed at, we were asked to provide catering for the food stalls. On big projects like this we all worked as a team alongside our chef, following his example and instructions. It was our responsibility to keep the facilities clean and in good working order and in accordance with food hygiene standards.
When we weren’t making food for school functions, we were tasked with making single meals and were allowed to take whatever we made home with us. From this, I developed my time management skills, understanding the importance of working to tight deadlines and the benefits of teamwork.

Presenter
May 2016 – Jun 2016
Lancaster and Morecambe College
The College was holding a music festival in the auditorium to enable the student bands gain exposure and raise some money for College by hosting a stall selling cakes and band merch outside the event.

I was originally brought in following my performance in "Great Expectations" as a host to play the crowd during the event, keeping them entertained while one band left and the next set up. I ended up improvising my set, spending about 15 minutes total riffing on the bands and their material.

Since I had to know the details of the show’s format, and had a certain amount of control over the flow as the presenter, I accompanied the organisers and negotiated with bands who weren’t sure if they wanted to participate and helped convince them to perform. This required good communication skills and enabled me to learn negotiation skills. I also helped working odd jobs, mostly manning the cake and merch stall outside and handling the money we collected.

Data Manager
Sep 2015 – Feb 2016
Lancaster and Morecambe College
I worked in the college’s office scanning hard copies of student records into the system and then organising the digital files in our database. This required attention to detail and a methodical approach.

Student Film Catering
Newport, South Wales
January 2022
I was asked to prepare 15 to 30 pre-planned vegan meals per day over the course of a week. I delivered the food to the set where it was picked up by a crew member. I kept a record of expenses so I could submit them for reimbursement by the production team. I had to organise with the crew to take a later train than originally planned.

Young Leader
September 15 - August 16
Lancaster and Morecambe 34th Scout Troop
After several years as a Scout, I moved up to being a Young Leader for the Beavers, in my Troop. I was mostly responsible for keeping them in check while the other leaders set things up, though sometimes I was responsible for planning and carrying out activities safely. I was the only older boy on their team, so I like to think they looked up to me.

Police Cadet
Lancaster and Morecambe Police Cadets
September 2012 – September 2015
Every Wednesday night I and about 20 other people my age met in a classroom at the local College to learn about what it meant to be a police officer. Almost every week we had a guest speaker come in from a different police branch to tell us about their jobs and how they did them.

Routinely we would drill a police physical exam. We were responsible for maintaining our own health and I followed a workout regimen I planned myself.

Outside the classroom we were taught how to properly use two-way radios and did lots of community outreach, both running our own stalls to show the public who we were and as volunteers. Once when we had our own stall at the local car boot sale the Rotary Club running it realised they didn’t have enough people to direct traffic, and since we had prior experience and hi-vis jackets we were quickly briefed on the one-way system and car park they had set up and then allowed to direct cars coming and going.

<u>What roles are you interested in?</u>
I’ve been working to improve my voice acting skills so I can record my writing to make sure it flows naturally and also getting back into writing stand-up comedy. I’m also experimenting with improv to get better at speaking from my heart and getting my thoughts on paper more quickly.

<u b id = int>Other interests</u /b>
Coding
Tinkering with code has given me experience conceptualising where I want a project to go and breaking it down into the required steps, problem solving as I go.

I also have experience relating other people’s solutions to my own coding queries. When looking for tutorials explaining issues you need to comprehend other people’s code to implement their solutions, which sometimes only solve one step of your problem.

Outside of languages related to web design, the main language I code in is Python which I use for quick calculations to analyse large data sets. I also have some experience using the OpenCV module to include camera input in my projects. I’m currently studying how to use the Natural Language Toolkit module to apply data analysis to my writing to understand how each word and sentence fit together and how to improve my flow. I also use the same tools to analyse pitching newsletters to find opportunities and understand which topics and formats are currently popular.

In the future I'll study programming in C to make programs I draft in Python more efficient.

Running
I’m a member of Parkrun and do a 5k every Saturday. Currently refining my running technique and taking the opportunity to catch up on some audio books. My dream is to finish within 21 minutes one day which would see me leading the pack.

Chess
I collect chess sets to play with friends. I also have a Chess.com account and I'm slowly working my way through their bots and hope to interact more with their online community. I also hope to learn the game of Xiangqi.
